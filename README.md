# FGD-learner
Data and code repository for "When Distributional Learning Succeeds and Fails: Modeling Acquisition of Filler-Gap Dependencies in Norwegian".

The repository contains three folders:
1. data
- wh-FGDs paths extracted from the nob-child, with ... % of the data manually checked (output_wh_corrected_oct23.xlsx)
- RC-FGDs paths extracted from the nob-child, with ... % of the data manually checked (output_rc_corrected_oct23.xlsx)
- example of raw data in tiger-XML format that can be used for testing FGD-extraction ()
- example output file with extracted FGDs

2. FGD-extraction
- script for extracting FGDs paths from LFG's f-structure (input: )
- 

3. learner-algorithm 
- python script with learner functions such as creating frequency distribution, calculating probability etc.  (learner_functions.py)
- 4 versions of the learner algorithm with data analysis (ngrams \times FGD, where ngrams: bigrams, trigrams and FGD:ÃŸ RC-FGDs, wh-FGDs)
